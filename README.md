## Path Towards AI Research Agent


Modern AI research requires mastering dozens of specialized tools and frameworks. 
AI Researchers spend more time debugging infrastructure than testing hypotheses—slowing the pace of scientific discovery. 
We provide a comprehensive library of expert-level research engineering skills that enable AI agents to autonomously implement and execute different stages of AI research experiments—from data preparation and model training to evaluation and deployment.
  - Specialized Expertise - Each skill provides deep, production-ready knowledge of a specific framework (Megatron-LM, vLLM, TRL, etc.)
  - End-to-End Coverage - 24/70 skills spanning model architecture, fine-tuning, post-training, distributed training, optimization, and inference
  - Research-Grade Quality - Documentation sourced from official repos, real GitHub issues, and battle-tested  production workflows
